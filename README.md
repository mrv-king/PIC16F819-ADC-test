# DESCRIPTION
An example of implementing an ADC on a Microchip PIC16F819 microcontroller and transmitting the received data via SPI. The internal oscillator is set to 8 MHz. Pins RA0-RA7 are initialized as analog inputs. Pins RB0-RB7 are initialized as outputs. This code was used to control the charging/discharging process of a custom built charger (12V, 3A).
